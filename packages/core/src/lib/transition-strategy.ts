/**
 * Creates a transition callback that can be used with framework-specific implementations
 * This is the core logic that frameworks can wrap with their own APIs
 *
 * UX Animation Behavior - 4 Main Scenarios:
 *
 * 1. No animation running + IN trigger:
 *    - Start entrance animation (0 → 1)
 *    - Return cleanup function for exit
 *
 * 2. No animation running + OUT trigger:
 *    - Clone element, start exit animation (1 → 0)
 *    - Remove clone when complete
 *
 * 3. IN animation running + OUT trigger:
 *    - Stop current IN animation (DOM is disappearing)
 *    - Clone element for exit animation
 *    - Create REVERSED IN animation (not OUT animation) with current state
 *    - This gives natural backward motion instead of jumping to OUT definition
 *
 * 4. OUT animation running + IN trigger:
 *    - Stop current OUT animation (cleanup any cloned elements)
 *    - Create REVERSED OUT animation (not IN animation) with current state
 *    - This gives natural backward motion instead of jumping to IN definition
 *    - Switch to entrance mode
 *
 * Closure Structure:
 * - Outer function: Returns entrance callback
 * - Inner function (entrance callback): Returns cleanup callback (exit)
 * - Cleanup callback: Handles exit transitions
