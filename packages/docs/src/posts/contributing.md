## Code of Conduct

First things first: Be nice! We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/). In short:

- Be respectful and inclusive
- No harassment, trolling, or spamming
- Gracefully accept constructive criticism
- Focus on what's best for the community

Remember, behind every GitHub username is a real person who, like you, loves smooth transitions!

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute to SSGOI:

1. **Code Contributions**: Got an idea for a new transition effect? Found a bug that's making transitions jankier than a rusty door hinge? Dive into the code!

2. **Documentation**: Help us make our docs clearer than a freshly Windex-ed window. Typos, unclear explanations, or missing information - all fair game!

3. **Bug Reports**: If you find a bug, report it! But remember, "It doesn't work" is about as helpful as a chocolate teapot. Give us details!

4. **Feature Requests**: Have an idea that'll make SSGOI even more awesome? We're all ears!

5. **Spreading the Word**: Love SSGOI? Tell the world! Tweet about it, blog about it, skywrite about it (okay, maybe not that last one).

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. Fork the SSGOI repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ssgoi.git
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   cd ssgoi
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a branch for your changes:
   ```
   git checkout -b my-awesome-feature
   ```
5. Make your changes, commit them, and push to your fork.
6. Open a pull request from your fork to the main SSGOI repository.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure your code follows our coding guidelines.
2. Update the documentation if you're changing functionality.
3. Include tests for new features or bug fixes.
4. Ensure all tests pass:
   ```
   npm run test
   ```
5. Write a clear, concise description of your changes in the pull request.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use TypeScript. It's like JavaScript, but with superpowers!
- Follow the existing code style. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
- Comment your code. Your future self (and other contributors) will thank you.
- Keep your transitions smooth and your code smoother.

## Documentation Guidelines

- Be clear and concise. Imagine you're explaining to a rubber duck.
- Use examples. Lots of examples. Did we mention examples?
- Keep the humor. We're serious about transitions, not about being serious.
- If you can explain it with a GIF, do it. Everyone loves a good GIF.

## Community and Communication

Remember, every contribution, no matter how small, moves us closer to a world of buttery-smooth page transitions. Together, we can make the web a more delightful place, one transition at a time!

Now go forth and contribute! May your pull requests be smooth and your merges conflict-free! 🎉🚀
