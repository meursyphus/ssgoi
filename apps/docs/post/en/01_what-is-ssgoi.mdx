Hello, I'm the creator of SSGOI. I'm Korean and currently working as a CPO at an AI startup. I haven't been developing for very long. After graduating from university and completing military service, I started programming in 2020. At that time, I worked on both backend and frontend, mainly using Spring and React.

Meanwhile, the tech leader at my first company taught me development as my mentor. Among the things he taught was Svelte. When I first heard about it, I wondered if I really needed to learn Svelte. But after becoming somewhat familiar with React, I'll never forget the shock I felt when I first visited the Svelte official website.

"Can I really implement things this simply in Svelte that I was doing in React?" I was amazed and spent nights going through the official documentation tutorials. After that, I fell in love with Svelte's charm and started spreading the word about Svelte in the Korean development community.

This library, SSGOI, was actually originally a Svelte-only library. I was amazed that you could implement page transition animations with just Svelte's concise syntax without any other libraries. This version of SSGOI applies insights learned from Svelte to React, aiming to support all frameworks in v2.

If you look at `packages/core`, you'll find vanilla JavaScript modules. Framework packages like `@ssgoi/react` and `@ssgoi/svelte` are just wrappers around core. We've built framework-independent modules to easily support page animation libraries for future frameworks as well.

Currently, one of my friends is creating @ssgoi/qwik, and I'm additionally working on the @ssgoi/vue version. Contributors for other frameworks are always welcome.
