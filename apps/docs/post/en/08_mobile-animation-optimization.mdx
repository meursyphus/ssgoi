Hello, I'm the maintainer of ssgoi.

Today we released ssgoi 2.5.2. The core focus of this version is **mobile environment optimization**.

## Why Rebuild?

Previously, we relied on an external library for animation implementation. It was a choice made for rapid development.

But user feedback started coming in:
- "It feels janky on mobile"
- "It breaks when I switch apps and come back"
- "It stutters on Galaxy devices"

The library we were using (an older version) didn't account for variable FPS at all.

**"Let's build it ourselves."**

## How We Built It

### Step 1: Study Good Code

We dissected GSAP's (20k stars) Ticker implementation:
- Delta Time Clamping
- Lag Smoothing
- Adaptive Frame Rate

We analyzed Svelte Motion's spring implementation:
- Semi-Implicit Euler
- Allen Chou's normalization technique

We also referenced React Native Reanimated's native optimizations.

### Step 2: Implement Core Optimizations

**Semi-Implicit Euler**
```typescript
// Velocity first, position later (order matters!)
velocity += -2*dt*ζ*ω*velocity + dt*ω²*(target - position);
position += dt*velocity;
```

**Variable FPS Defense Code**
```typescript
// 1. Clamp dt
dt = Math.min(dt, 0.1);

// 2. Handle background return
if (elapsed > 500) {
  startTime += elapsed - 33;
}
```

**RAF Optimization**
```typescript
// Singleton pattern - call RAF only once
ticker.subscribe(animation.update);
```

### Step 3: Real Device Testing

- iPhone 13, 14 Pro
- Galaxy S21, S23
- Low-end Android (Galaxy A12)

Confirmed stable operation on all devices ✅

## Results

**Bundle Size**: Slightly increased (custom implementation)
**Performance**: Significantly improved (especially on mobile)
**Stability**: Background return issues resolved

## Usage

Your existing code works as-is:
```typescript
import { transition } from 'ssgoi';

transition({
  from: elementA,
  to: elementB,
  duration: 300
});
```

Just update:
```bash
npm update ssgoi
```

## Closing Thoughts

Lessons learned from running an open-source library:
- User feedback is most important
- You need to read a lot of good code
- Small optimizations add up to make a big difference

Thanks to your feedback, we've built a better library.
Thank you! 🙏
