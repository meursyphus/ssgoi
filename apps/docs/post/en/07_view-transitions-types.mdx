Ever visited a website and thought, "Wow, this feels like a native app"? The secret behind 80% of that feeling is **page transition effects**. Today, let's dive deep into SSGOI's various View Transitions with live demos!

## Why View Transitions Matter

When we use smartphone apps, screen transitions happen naturally. Opening a chat in KakaoTalk, zooming photos on Instagram - these smooth transitions make apps feel "premium."

What about the web? Most of the time, pages just **snap!** - they change instantly. Like switching TV channels. This experience constantly reminds users "Oh, I'm using a website."

**SSGOI's View Transitions** eliminate this gap. You can implement native app-like natural screen transitions on the web!

## The 3 Paradigms of View Transitions

Screen transitions aren't just about "making things pretty." They're crucial UX elements that **visually communicate where users are navigating**. SSGOI categorizes them into 3 main patterns based on navigation types:

### 1. üåÖ Top-Level Navigation: Fade Transition

**"Going somewhere completely different"**

From home to settings, from shopping to profile... For navigation between unrelated pages, **Fade** transition works perfectly. The screen smoothly disappears and reappears, naturally conveying that the context has completely changed.

<ViewTransitionDemo type="fade" />

Fade is the most basic yet powerful transition. Not too flashy, yet much smoother than static page changes. It feels especially seamless in dark mode.

### 2. üèóÔ∏è Hierarchical Navigation: Drill & Hero Transitions

**"Going deeper or zooming in"**

#### Drill: Navigate Like Folders

When **exploring hierarchical structures** like Settings ‚Üí Notifications or Category ‚Üí Subcategory, Drill transition is perfect. Think of iOS Settings app - that feeling of new screens sliding in from the right!

<ViewTransitionDemo type="drill" />

The key here is **directionality**. Entering from the right, exiting to the left. Users naturally understand "Oh, I've gone deeper into a level."

#### Hero: Small Things Growing Big

From product list to detail page, from gallery to fullscreen... When you want to give the feeling of **the same object expanding**, use Hero transition!

<ViewTransitionDemo type="hero" />

Images or cards naturally expanding into detail views - doesn't it feel just like a native app? Services like Pinterest and Medium make great use of this pattern.

#### Pinterest: Cards Unfolding Specially

A variant of Hero where cards expand in place to fill the entire screen. Inspired by the Pinterest app.

<ViewTransitionDemo type="pinterest" />

Unlike regular Hero, cards **expand in place**, making it especially effective in grid layouts. Users clearly perceive which item they selected.

### 3. üìñ Sibling Navigation: Scroll Transition

**"Turning to the next page"**

Between blog posts, onboarding steps, gallery images... When **sequentially exploring content at the same level**, Scroll transition feels natural.

<ViewTransitionDemo type="scroll" />

In web environments familiar with vertical scrolling, this transition provides "natural continuity." It feels like scrolling through a long page. Particularly powerful for storytelling or tutorials.

## Practical Tips

### 1. Consistency is Key

Maintain the same patterns throughout your app. Always Drill for hierarchical navigation, always Scroll for sibling navigation... This consistency provides users with "learnable patterns."

### 2. Control Speed with Spring Physics

SSGOI uses physics-based spring animations. Fade transitions feel more natural when OUT animations are faster than IN:

```typescript
// Faster OUT, smoother IN
fade({
  outSpring: {
    stiffness: 400,  // Quick disappear
    damping: 30
  },
  inSpring: {
    stiffness: 200,  // Smooth appear
    damping: 25
  }
})

// When you need fast transitions
fade({
  spring: {
    stiffness: 350,
    damping: 30
  }
})

// Elegant slow transitions
fade({
  spring: {
    stiffness: 150,
    damping: 25
  }
})
```

### 3. Consider Mobile Optimization

On mobile, you might want different transitions or disable them entirely for performance or UX:

```typescript
// Use different transitions on mobile
const config = {
  defaultTransition: isMobile ? slide() : fade(),
  // Slide might feel more natural on mobile
};

// Disable animations on low-end devices
const config = {
  defaultTransition: isLowEndDevice ? null : fade(),
  // null disables transitions for instant changes
};

// Adjust based on user preferences
const config = {
  defaultTransition: userPrefersReducedMotion ? null : fade({
    spring: { stiffness: 300, damping: 28 }
  })
};
```

### 4. Don't Forget Performance

Even fancy transitions are counterproductive if they stutter! SSGOI automatically handles GPU acceleration and will-change optimization, but be careful with heavy images or complex layouts.

## Browser Compatibility?

No worries! Unlike Chrome's View Transitions API, SSGOI works in **all modern browsers**:

- ‚úÖ Chrome/Edge
- ‚úÖ Firefox  
- ‚úÖ Safari
- ‚úÖ Mobile browsers

What about IE? Well... is anyone still worrying about IE in 2024? üòÖ

## Wrapping Up

View Transitions aren't just "pretty effects." They're powerful tools for **visualizing users' mental models**.

Where you came from, where you're going, where you are now... Naturally conveying all this information - that's the essence of good View Transitions.

With SSGOI, you can easily implement all of this. How about making your website feel like a native app?
