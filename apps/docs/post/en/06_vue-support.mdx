We're thrilled to announce that **SSGOI now officially supports Vue 3**! After React and Svelte, Vue developers can now enjoy the same buttery-smooth, native app-like page transitions that make web apps feel delightful.

## What is SSGOI?

SSGOI (Ïì±Ïò§Ïù¥) is a universal page transition library that transforms static page navigations into smooth, delightful experiences. Unlike the browser's View Transition API which only works in Chrome, SSGOI works across all modern browsers - Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and more.

## Why Vue Support Matters

Vue is one of the most loved frontend frameworks with a vibrant ecosystem. With Vue 3's Composition API and improved performance, it was the perfect time to bring SSGOI's magic to the Vue community. Whether you're building with Vue Router or Nuxt 3, SSGOI integrates seamlessly without changing your existing routing logic.

## Getting Started is Dead Simple

Install the Vue package:

```bash
npm install @ssgoi/vue
```

Wrap your app with the `Ssgoi` provider:

```vue
<template>
  <Ssgoi :config="config">
    <RouterView />
  </Ssgoi>
</template>

<script setup>
import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/vue';
import { fade } from '@ssgoi/vue/view-transitions';

const config = {
  defaultTransition: fade()
};
</script>
```

Wrap your pages with `SsgoiTransition`:

```vue
<template>
  <SsgoiTransition id="/home">
    <h1>Welcome to Vue + SSGOI!</h1>
  </SsgoiTransition>
</template>

<script setup>
import { SsgoiTransition } from '@ssgoi/vue';
</script>
```

That's it! Your Vue app now has smooth page transitions.

## Vue-Specific Features

### 1. Custom Directive Support

Vue developers love directives, so we created `v-transition` for animating individual elements:

```vue
<div v-transition="{
  key: 'hero',
  in: fadeIn(),
  out: scaleOut()
}">
  <img src="hero.jpg" alt="Hero" />
</div>
```

### 2. Composition API Integration

For those who prefer the Composition API:

```javascript
import { useSsgoi } from '@ssgoi/vue';

const ssgoi = useSsgoi();
// Access transition context and state
```

### 3. Perfect Nuxt 3 Compatibility

SSGOI works flawlessly with Nuxt 3's SSR and hybrid rendering:

```vue
<!-- app.vue -->
<template>
  <Ssgoi :config="config">
    <NuxtPage />
  </Ssgoi>
</template>
```

No hydration issues, SEO-friendly, and works with Nuxt's powerful routing system.

## The Same Transitions You Love

All the beautiful transitions from React and Svelte are available:

- **fade()** - Smooth opacity transitions
- **slide()** - Directional sliding effects
- **scale()** - Zoom in/out animations
- **hero()** - Shared element transitions
- **pinterest()** - Pinterest-style expand effect
- **ripple()** - Material Design ripple

Plus element-level animations like `fadeIn()`, `slideUp()`, `bounce()`, `blur()`, and more!

## Spring Physics for Natural Motion

Every animation uses spring physics for that natural, responsive feel:

```javascript
slide({
  direction: 'left',
  spring: {
    stiffness: 300,
    damping: 30
  }
})
```
