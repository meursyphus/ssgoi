## Configuration Interface

### SsgoiConfig

```typescript
interface SsgoiConfig {
  transitions: Array<{
    from: string; // Source route pattern
    to: string; // Destination route pattern
    transition: SggoiTransition;
    symmetric?: boolean; // Auto-generate bidirectional transition
  }>;
  defaultTransition?: SggoiTransition;
}
```

### Basic Configuration

```jsx
import { Ssgoi } from "@ssgoi/react";
import { fade, scroll, drill } from "@ssgoi/react/view-transitions";

const config = {
  defaultTransition: fade(),
  transitions: [
    { from: "/", to: "/about", transition: scroll({ direction: "up" }) },
    { from: "/about", to: "/", transition: scroll({ direction: "down" }) },
  ],
};

<Ssgoi config={config}>{children}</Ssgoi>;
```

## Route Matching Rules

### Pattern Types

1. **Exact Match**: `/home` → Matches exactly with `/home`
2. **Wildcard Suffix**: `/products/*` → Matches `/products/123`
3. **Full Wildcard**: `*` → Matches all routes

### Matching Priority

More specific patterns take precedence:

```javascript
transitions: [
  // 1st priority: Exact match
  { from: "/blog/post-1", to: "/blog/post-2", transition: scroll() },

  // 2nd priority: Wildcard match
  { from: "/blog/*", to: "/blog/*", transition: fade() },

  // 3rd priority: defaultTransition
];
```

## Symmetric Option

Automatically generates bidirectional transitions:

```javascript
{
  from: '/home',
  to: '/about',
  transition: fade(),
  symmetric: true  // Automatically generates reverse transition
}

// The above configuration works as follows:
// /home → /about: fade
// /about → /home: fade (auto-generated)
```

## View Transition Structure

View Transition follows the same structure as Element Transition:

```typescript
interface ViewTransition {
  in?: (
    element: HTMLElement,
    context?: SggoiTransitionContext
  ) => TransitionConfig;
  out?: (
    element: HTMLElement,
    context?: SggoiTransitionContext
  ) => TransitionConfig;
}
```

- **out**: Applied to from page (exiting page)
- **in**: Applied to to page (entering page)

## Context Object

The scroll difference between the previous page and current page is passed as the second argument to View Transition:

```typescript
interface SggoiTransitionContext {
  scrollOffset: {
    x: number; // Scroll X difference between previous and current page
    y: number; // Scroll Y difference between previous and current page
  };
}

// Example: Scroll-aware transition
const scrollAwareTransition = {
  in: (element, context) => {
    const { scrollOffset } = context;
    return {
      prepare: (el) => {
        // Start by moving by the scroll difference
        el.style.transform = `translateY(${-scrollOffset.y}px)`;
      },
      tick: (progress) => ({
        // Return to original position
        transform: `translateY(${-scrollOffset.y * (1 - progress)}px)`,
      }),
    };
  },
};
```

## SsgoiTransition Component

Wrapper component that wraps each page:

```jsx
<SsgoiTransition id="/page-path">
  <PageContent />
</SsgoiTransition>
```

- `id`: Identifier used for route matching
- This ID is matched against from/to patterns in config

## Operation Flow

1. **Route Change Detection**: Router changes route
2. **Pattern Matching**: Find transition to apply using from/to patterns
3. **Out Animation**: Apply out transition to current page
4. **Synchronization**: Wait for out and in animation preparation
5. **In Animation**: Apply in transition to new page
6. **Completion**: Clean up when both animations complete

## Practical Examples

### Hierarchical Navigation

```javascript
const config = {
  transitions: [
    // List → Detail
    {
      from: "/products",
      to: "/products/*",
      transition: drill({ direction: 'enter' }),
      symmetric: true, // Auto-handle Detail → List too
    },

    // Tab navigation
    { from: "/tab1", to: "/tab2", transition: scroll({ direction: "up" }) },
    { from: "/tab2", to: "/tab3", transition: scroll({ direction: "up" }) },
    { from: "/tab3", to: "/tab2", transition: scroll({ direction: "down" }) },
    { from: "/tab2", to: "/tab1", transition: scroll({ direction: "down" }) },
  ],
};
```
