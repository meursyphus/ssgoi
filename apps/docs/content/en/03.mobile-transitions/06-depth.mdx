# Depth Transition

The depth transition expresses **hierarchical movement along the Z-axis**. It's the same concept as Material Design's Shared Z-Axis transition, where two screens combine scale and fade in the same direction to create a sense of "depth".

## Demo

<ViewTransitionDemo type="depth" />

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

Use the depth transition when **moving one level up or down in your app's hierarchy**. It naturally creates an experience of expanding from a small trigger (icon, button) to a full screen.

<SuitabilityTable
  items={[
    {
      label: "Unrelated content",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Not suitable for navigation between independent sections as it doesn't convey hierarchical connection."
    },
    {
      label: "Top-level transition",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "For navigation between equal-level items like bottom navigation, swap transition is more appropriate."
    },
    {
      label: "Hierarchical relationship",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Optimal when moving from icon to full screen, or from parent level to child level."
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Key Use Cases
- Search icon → Search screen (from small icon to full screen)
- Settings icon → Settings screen (from trigger to detail screen)
- Notification icon → Notification list (from summary to detail)
- Category → Subcategory (hierarchical navigation)
- Product list → Product detail (diving deeper from list)

### Why Does It Work This Way?

1. **Forward movement (enter)**: The new screen starts small in the front and expands while appearing, while the previous screen is pushed back and expands as it disappears. This gives a sense of "diving deeper".

2. **Backward movement (exit)**: The current screen shrinks towards the front and disappears, while the previous screen appears from behind while shrinking. This gives a sense of "emerging from depth".

3. **Hierarchical understanding**: The consistent direction of scale movement allows users to intuitively understand which hierarchical level they're currently at.

### Motion Design

**Forward (enter) motion**:
- **Outgoing page**: scale 1 → 1.05 + fade out (expands backward and disappears)
- **Incoming page**: scale 0.95 → 1 + fade in (comes forward and appears)

**Backward (exit) motion**:
- **Outgoing page**: scale 1 → 0.95 + fade out (shrinks forward and disappears)
- **Incoming page**: scale 1.05 → 1 + fade in (appears from back to front)

## Basic Usage

### Transition Setup

::code-group

```tsx [React]
import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
import { depth } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/search',
        transition: depth({ direction: 'enter' }),
        symmetric: true // Automatically applies exit direction on back navigation
      }
    ]
  }}
>
  {children}
</Ssgoi>
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
  import { depth } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';
</script>

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/search',
        transition: depth({ direction: 'enter' }),
        symmetric: true
      }
    ]
  }}
>
  <slot />
</Ssgoi>
```

### Direction Setting

Use the `direction` option to specify the hierarchical movement direction:

- **`enter`**: Dive deeper (default)
- **`exit`**: Emerge from depth

```typescript
// When entering a child level
depth({ direction: 'enter' })

// When returning to a parent level
depth({ direction: 'exit' })

// Using symmetric: true automatically creates the opposite direction
```

## Best Practices

### Good Examples

- Search icon → Search full screen
- Product card → Product detail page
- Settings button → Settings screen
- Notification bell → Notification list
- Category → Subcategory

### Bad Examples

- Navigation between bottom navigation tabs → Use swap
- Navigation between independent sections → Use fade
- Opening a modal → Use sheet transition
