# Snap Transition

Snap transition is a **fast and lightweight transition for top-level navigation**. The previous screen fades out, and the new screen appears with a short slide (8px) in the direction, creating a snappy, haptic-like feel.

## Demo

<ViewTransitionDemo type="snap" />

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

Snap transition is optimized for **directional navigation** with ordered tabs, such as **bottom navigation or tab bars**.

<SuitabilityTable
  items={[
    {
      label: "Directional Tab Switching",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Explicitly set left/right direction based on tab order."
    },
    {
      label: "Quick Transitions",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Short distance and fast spring provide instant feedback."
    },
    {
      label: "Hierarchical Relationship",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "For parent/child level navigation, depth transition is more appropriate."
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Key Use Cases
- Switching between ordered bottom navigation tabs (Home → Search → Profile)
- Top-level menu transitions with left/right directionality
- Moving between adjacent tabs in a tab bar

### Why Does It Work This Way?

1. **Previous Screen Slide + Fade Out**: The current screen slides 8px in the movement direction while fading out.

2. **New Screen Slide + Fade In**: After the previous screen completely disappears, the new screen slides in 8px from the opposite direction while fading in.

3. **Directionality**: If the tab is on the right, it enters from the right; if on the left, it enters from the left.

### Motion Design

**OUT (Departing Page)**:
- **opacity**: 1 → 0 (fade out)
- **translateX**: 0 → ∓8px (slide in movement direction)

**IN (Arriving Page)**:
- **opacity**: 0 → 1 (fade in)
- **translateX**: ±8px → 0 (enters from opposite direction)
- **Start timing**: After OUT animation completes

## Basic Usage

### Bottom Navigation Setup

Since snap transition is directional, you need to explicitly set both directions.

::code-group

```tsx [React]
import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
import { snap } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      // Moving to right tab (left: enters from right)
      { from: '/home', to: '/search', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      { from: '/search', to: '/profile', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      { from: '/home', to: '/profile', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      // Moving to left tab (right: enters from left)
      { from: '/search', to: '/home', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
      { from: '/profile', to: '/search', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
      { from: '/profile', to: '/home', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
    ]
  }}
>
  {children}
</Ssgoi>
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
  import { snap } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';
</script>

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      // Moving to right tab (left: enters from right)
      { from: '/home', to: '/search', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      { from: '/search', to: '/profile', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      { from: '/home', to: '/profile', transition: snap({ direction: 'left' }) },
      // Moving to left tab (right: enters from left)
      { from: '/search', to: '/home', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
      { from: '/profile', to: '/search', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
      { from: '/profile', to: '/home', transition: snap({ direction: 'right' }) },
    ]
  }}
>
  <slot />
</Ssgoi>
```

::

> **Note**: Using `symmetric: true` applies the same direction for both ways, so for snap transitions you need to explicitly set both directions to get correct directional behavior.

## Direction Settings

Snap transition controls slide direction with the `direction` option:

- **`left`**: When moving to a right tab (new screen enters from right)
- **`right`**: When moving to a left tab (new screen enters from left)

```tsx
// Home → Search (to right tab): enters from right
snap({ direction: 'left' })

// Search → Home (to left tab): enters from left
snap({ direction: 'right' })
```

## Swap vs Snap

| Feature | Swap | Snap |
|---------|------|------|
| IN effect | scale + fade | slide + fade |
| Direction | none | yes (left/right) |
| Feel | smooth replacement | quick transition |
| Use case | general tab switching | ordered tab switching |

## Best Practices

### Good Examples

- Transitions between adjacent bottom navigation tabs
- Used with left/right swipe gestures
- Tab bar transitions with clear order

### Bad Examples

- Independent sections without order → use swap transition
- List → detail page → use depth transition
- Hierarchical navigation → use depth transition
