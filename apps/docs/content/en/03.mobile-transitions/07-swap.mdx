# Swap Transition

Swap transition is designed for **switching between top-level screens**. Similar to Material Design's Fade Through pattern, it creates a natural transition where the previous screen fades out, then the new screen appears from a smaller state, growing to full size.

## Demo

<ViewTransitionDemo type="swap" />

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

Use swap transition when **navigating between independent sections at the top level**. It's primarily optimized for bottom navigation, tab switching, and top-level menu transitions.

      label: "Independent Sections",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Works naturally for navigating between unrelated top-level content."
    }
  ]}
/>

#### Key Use Cases
- Bottom navigation tab switching (Home ↔ Search ↔ Profile)
- Top-level menu switching (Dashboard ↔ Settings ↔ Notifications)
- Independent section switching (News ↔ Weather ↔ Sports)

### Why Does It Work This Way?

1. **Previous Screen Fade Out**: The current screen simply fades out with transparency. It exits smoothly without any scale changes.

2. **New Screen Fade In + Scale Up**: After the previous screen completely disappears, the new screen starts from a slightly smaller state (0.95 scale) and grows to normal size (1.0 scale) while appearing.

3. **Sequential Execution**: The IN animation starts after the OUT animation completes, ensuring the two screens don't overlap and the switch is clear.

### Motion Design

**OUT (Departing Page)**:
- **opacity**: 1 → 0 (fade out only)
- **scale**: no change

**IN (Arriving Page)**:
- **opacity**: 0 → 1 (fade in)
- **scale**: 0.95 → 1 (starts small, grows to normal size)
- **Start timing**: After OUT animation completes

## Basic Usage

### Bottom Navigation Setup

::code-group

```tsx [React]
import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
import { swap } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/search',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      },
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/profile',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      },
      {
        from: '/search',
        to: '/profile',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      }
    ]
  }}
>
  {children}
</Ssgoi>
```

```svelte [Svelte]
<script lang="ts">
  import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
  import { swap } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';
</script>

<Ssgoi
  config={{
    transitions: [
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/search',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      },
      {
        from: '/home',
        to: '/profile',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      },
      {
        from: '/search',
        to: '/profile',
        transition: swap(),
        symmetric: true
      }
    ]
  }}
>
  <slot />
</Ssgoi>
```

## Best Practices

### Good Examples

- Switching between bottom navigation tabs
- Navigating between top-level menu sections
- Switching between independent dashboard views

### Bad Examples

- List → Detail page → Use depth transition
- Modal or bottom sheet → Use sheet transition
- Hierarchical navigation → Use depth transition

## Related Transitions

- **[Depth](/en/mobile-transitions/depth)**: For navigating between screens with hierarchical relationships
- **[Fade](/en/basic-transitions/fade)**: When you only need a simple fade
- **[Sheet](/en/mobile-transitions/sheet)**: For modals or bottom sheets
