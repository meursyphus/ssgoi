# Film Transition

Film transition is a cinematic transition pattern used when navigating between unrelated or distant content. Similar to fade, it conveys entering a completely new area but provides a more special visual experience.

## Demo

<div style={{ display: 'flex', justifyContent: 'center', margin: '2rem 0' }}>
  <img src="/view-transitions/film.gif" alt="Film transition demo" style={{ maxWidth: '100%', borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</div>

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

Film transition is used for **Context Changes**.

#### Suitability by Content Relationship

<SuitabilityTable
  items={[
    {
      label: "Unrelated Content",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Navigation between completely independent sections (Home → Settings)",
    },
    {
      label: "Sibling Relationship",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Scroll is recommended for same-level content",
    },
    {
      label: "Hierarchical Relationship",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Expansion transitions like hero are recommended for parent-child structures",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Key Use Cases

- **Top-level Navigation**: Moving between sections in bottom tabs or sidebar menus
- **Context Switching**: Transitions between screens with no connection points
- **Starting New Tasks**: Entering completely different task flows
- **Special Moment Direction**: When visual emphasis is needed for important screen transitions

### Why Does It Work This Way?

1. **Clean Separation**: Creates a clear boundary between previous and new screens like fade
2. **Visual Interest**: More dynamic transition than simple fade to capture user attention
3. **Premium Experience**: Enhances app quality and polish with special transition effects

### Motion Design

Film transition is inspired by the mechanism of film passing through a projector.

**Outgoing Screen Motion**
The current screen shrinks while moving upward. Like a film frame passing through a projector lens and moving up, the screen gets smaller and feels like it's moving away from view. During this process, black margins appear around the page, making the frame boundaries clear.

**Frame Interval Direction**
A brief interval is exposed between two screens. This represents the black gap between frames on an actual film strip, visually communicating that one scene ends and the next begins.

**Incoming Screen Appearance**
The new screen appears from below at a small size and gradually expands while moving up. It evokes the process of a film frame reaching the projector lens and being magnified to screen size. Finally, it perfectly focuses on the screen, completing the transition.

This sequence provides users with a clear visual metaphor of "moving to a new scene" along with the romantic sensibility of analog cinema.

## Basic Usage

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }, { label: "Angular", value: "angular" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
    import { film } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

    const config = {
      defaultTransition: film()
    };

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <Ssgoi config={config}>
          {/* App content */}
        </Ssgoi>
      );
    }
    ```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
      import { film } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';

      const config = {
        defaultTransition: film()
      };
    </script>

    <Ssgoi {config}>
      <slot />
    </Ssgoi>
    ```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="angular">
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from "@angular/core";
    import { RouterOutlet } from "@angular/router";
    import { Ssgoi } from "@ssgoi/angular";
    import { film } from "@ssgoi/angular/view-transitions";
    import type { SsgoiConfig } from "@ssgoi/angular";

    @Component({
      selector: "app-root",
      standalone: true,
      imports: [RouterOutlet, Ssgoi],
      template: `
        <div
          ssgoi
          [config]="config"
          style="position: relative; min-height: 100vh;"
        >
          <router-outlet />
        </div>
      `
    })
    export class AppComponent {
      config: SsgoiConfig = {
        defaultTransition: film()
      };
    }
    ```
  </TabPanel>

## Real-world Examples

### 1. Tab Navigation

Navigation between main sections in bottom tab bar or top tabs:

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }, { label: "Angular", value: "angular" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    const config = {
      transitions: [
        {
          from: '/home',
          to: '/profile',
          transition: film(),
          symmetric: true
        },
        {
          from: '/home',
          to: '/settings',
          transition: film(),
          symmetric: true
        }
      ]
    };
    ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      const config = {
        transitions: [
          {
            from: '/home',
            to: '/profile',
            transition: film(),
            symmetric: true
          },
          {
            from: '/home',
            to: '/settings',
            transition: film(),
            symmetric: true
          }
        ]
      };
    </script>
    ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="angular">
    ```typescript
    import { Component } from "@angular/core";
    import { Ssgoi } from "@ssgoi/angular";
    import { film } from "@ssgoi/angular/view-transitions";
    import type { SsgoiConfig } from "@ssgoi/angular";

    @Component({
      selector: "app-root",
      standalone: true,
      imports: [Ssgoi],
      template: `
        <div ssgoi [config]="config">
          <!-- App content -->
        </div>
      `
    })
    export class AppComponent {
      config: SsgoiConfig = {
        transitions: [
          {
            from: '/home',
            to: '/profile',
            transition: film(),
            symmetric: true
          },
          {
            from: '/home',
            to: '/settings',
            transition: film(),
            symmetric: true
          }
        ]
      };
    }
    ```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Accessibility

- Animation automatically disabled when `prefers-reduced-motion` is set
- Screen readers correctly recognize content changes during transitions
- Fully compatible with keyboard navigation

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use as default for top-level navigation
- Use when content completely changes
- Use when special brand experience is needed

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't use for navigation between related content (use slide or scroll)
- Avoid overly complex animations (users may feel dizzy)
- Don't use for partial UI changes
