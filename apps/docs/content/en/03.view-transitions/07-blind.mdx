# Blind Transition

The blind transition uses multiple bars that sequentially cover and reveal the screen during page transitions. It's suitable for transitions between unrelated or distant content.

## Demo

<ViewTransitionDemo type="blind" />

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

Use blind transitions for **unrelated content** or when moving to a **completely new context**.

#### Suitability by Content Relationship

<SuitabilityTable
  items={[
    {
      label: "Unrelated Content",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Moving to completely different topics or sections",
    },
    {
      label: "Sibling Relationship",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Slide is more suitable for same-level content",
    },
    {
      label: "Hierarchical Relationship",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Drill is more suitable for parent-child relationships",
    },
  ]}
/>

### Why Does It Work This Way?

The blind completely covers the screen before revealing the new screen, visually disconnecting from the previous content. This clearly communicates to users that they've moved to a completely new context.

### Motion Design

```
1. OUT: Blinds close sequentially, covering the screen
2. Hold: Screen remains covered briefly
3. IN: Blinds open sequentially, revealing the new screen
```

## Basic Usage

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
    import { blind } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

    const config = {
      defaultTransition: blind()
    };

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <Ssgoi config={config}>
          {/* App content */}
        </Ssgoi>
      );
    }
    ```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
      import { blind } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';

      const config = {
        defaultTransition: blind()
      };
    </script>

    <Ssgoi {config}>
      <slot />
    </Ssgoi>
    ```

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Options

```typescript
interface BlindOptions {
  // Spring config
  inSpring?: SpringConfig; // IN animation (default: { stiffness: 75, damping: 25 })
  outSpring?: SpringConfig; // OUT animation (default: { stiffness: 80, damping: 25 })

  // Timing
  transitionDelay?: number; // Delay between OUT and IN (default: 300ms)
  staggerDelay?: number; // Delay between blinds (default: 100ms)

  // Visual
  blindCount?: number; // Number of blinds (default: 10)
  direction?: "horizontal" | "vertical"; // Direction (default: 'horizontal')
  blindColor?: string; // Color (default: '#000000')
}
```

### Customization Examples

```tsx
// Fast transition
blind({
  staggerDelay: 20,
  transitionDelay: 100,
});

// Vertical blinds
blind({
  direction: "vertical",
  blindCount: 15,
});

// Smooth transition
blind({
  outSpring: { stiffness: 60, damping: 20 },
  inSpring: { stiffness: 50, damping: 18 },
});

// Color change
blind({
  blindColor: "#1a1a1a",
});
```

## Real-World Examples

### Home to Settings

```tsx
{
  from: '/home',
  to: '/settings',
  transition: blind()
}
```

### Between Categories

```tsx
{
  from: '/shop/*',
  to: '/blog/*',
  transition: blind({
    blindCount: 12,
    staggerDelay: 25
  })
}
```

### Dashboard After Login

```tsx
{
  from: '/login',
  to: '/dashboard',
  transition: blind({
    transitionDelay: 500,
    blindColor: '#0f172a'
  })
}
```

## Comparison with Other Transitions

- **vs Fade**: Blind provides more dramatic and clear separation
- **vs Slide**: Blind has no directionality, suitable for unrelated content
- **vs Drill**: Blind is used for horizontal movement without hierarchy

## Performance Considerations

- Blinds are dynamically created and automatically removed after animation
- Uses GPU acceleration for smooth animations
- More than 20 blinds may impact performance on low-end devices
