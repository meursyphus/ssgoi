# Jaemin Transition

The Jaemin transition is a creative transition effect created by [Jaemin Cheon (elrion018)](https://github.com/elrion018). It provides a dramatic transition where the previous page fades out while the new page starts from a small dot and rotates to fill the entire screen.

## Demo

<ViewTransitionDemo type="jaemin" />

**Try navigating between tabs to see the difference:**
- **Home ↔ Premium ↔ Achievement**: Experience the dramatic Jaemin transition with rotation and scaling
- **Settings**: Uses standard browser navigation (no special transition) for comparison

Notice how the Jaemin transition creates a sense of excitement and importance, while regular navigation feels more subdued - perfect for demonstrating when to use each approach.

## UX Principles

### When to Use?

The Jaemin transition is used to emphasize **Special Moments**.

#### Suitability by Content Relationship

<SuitabilityTable
  items={[
    {
      label: "Special Actions",
      suitable: "yes",
      description: "Completing important tasks or achievements",
    },
    {
      label: "Regular Navigation",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Too dramatic for normal page transitions",
    },
    {
      label: "Frequent Actions",
      suitable: "no",
      description: "Can be overwhelming if used repeatedly",
    },
  ]}
/>

#### Key Use Cases

- **Achievement Unlocks**: When users complete important milestones
- **Special Features**: Accessing premium or hidden content
- **Celebratory Moments**: Success states or rewards
- **Easter Eggs**: Hidden features or surprise interactions

### Why Does It Work This Way?

1. **Dramatic Emphasis**: The rotation and scale create a sense of importance
2. **Visual Delight**: Unexpected motion adds personality to the interface
3. **Memorable Experience**: Unique transition makes moments stand out
4. **Creative Expression**: Shows attention to detail and craftsmanship

### Motion Design

The Jaemin transition combines multiple animation techniques for a unique effect.

**Outgoing Screen Motion**
The current screen begins to fade out gradually. This creates a soft departure that doesn't compete with the incoming animation, allowing the new content to take center stage.

**The Rotation Entry**
The new screen emerges from the center as a tiny point, then expands outward while rotating. This spiral growth creates a sense of energy and excitement, as if the new content is bursting forth with enthusiasm.

**Scale and Timing**
The combination of rotation and scaling is carefully timed. The rotation completes just as the screen reaches full size, creating a satisfying resolution to the animation sequence.

## Basic Usage

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/react';
    import { jaemin } from '@ssgoi/react/view-transitions';

    const config = {
      defaultTransition: jaemin()
    };

    export default function App() {
      return (
        <Ssgoi config={config}>
          {/* App content */}
        </Ssgoi>
      );
    }
    ```

  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      import { Ssgoi } from '@ssgoi/svelte';
      import { jaemin } from '@ssgoi/svelte/view-transitions';

      const config = {
        defaultTransition: jaemin()
      };
    </script>

    <Ssgoi {config}>
      <slot />
    </Ssgoi>
    ```

  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Configuration Options

```typescript
jaemin({
  spring?: {
    stiffness?: number;  // Animation spring stiffness (default: 50)
    damping?: number;    // Animation spring damping (default: 30)
  };
  initialRotation?: number;      // Initial rotation angle in degrees (default: 45)
  initialScale?: number;         // Initial scale factor (default: 0.01)
  rotationTriggerPoint?: number; // Progress point where rotation starts 0-1 (default: 0.8)
})
```


## Practical Examples

### 1. Achievement Unlock

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    const config = {
      transitions: [
        {
          from: '/challenge-complete',
          to: '/achievement',
          transition: jaemin({ duration: 1000 })
        }
      ]
    };
    ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      const config = {
        transitions: [
          {
            from: '/challenge-complete',
            to: '/achievement',
            transition: jaemin({ duration: 1000 })
          }
        ]
      };
    </script>
    ```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

### 2. Premium Feature Access

<Tabs items={[{ label: "React", value: "react" }, { label: "Svelte", value: "svelte" }]}>
  <TabPanel value="react">
    ```tsx
    const config = {
      transitions: [
        {
          from: '/upgrade',
          to: '/premium-features',
          transition: jaemin({ rotation: 1080 })
        }
      ]
    };
    ```
  </TabPanel>
  <TabPanel value="svelte">
    ```svelte
    <script>
      const config = {
        transitions: [
          {
            from: '/upgrade',
            to: '/premium-features',
            transition: jaemin({ rotation: 1080 })
          }
        ]
      };
    </script>
    ```
  </TabPanel>
</Tabs>

## Accessibility

- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` settings
- Screen readers announce content changes appropriately
- Keyboard navigation remains functional during transitions

## Best Practices

### ✅ DO

- Use for truly special moments
- Reserve for achievements and rewards
- Apply to easter eggs and surprises
- Use sparingly for maximum impact

### ❌ DON'T

- Don't use for regular navigation
- Avoid in frequently accessed areas
- Don't apply to error states
- Never use for critical user flows

## Performance Notes

The Jaemin transition uses GPU-accelerated transforms for smooth performance. However, due to its complex animation, consider:

- Testing on lower-end devices
- Providing a simpler fallback for performance-constrained environments
- Using the `prefers-reduced-motion` media query for accessibility
