## Why SSGOI?

### 1. Works in All Browsers

Unlike the browser's Chrome View Transition API, SSGOI provides a consistent experience across all modern browsers. It ensures the same animations work in Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.

  </Card>
  <Card title="Safari">

  </Card>
</Grid>

### 2. Perfect Server-Side Rendering Support

- **SSR/SSG Compatible**: Works flawlessly with Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit without hydration issues
- **SEO Friendly**: Animations don't affect search engine optimization
- **Optimized Initial Load**: Leverages server-rendered HTML as-is

### 3. Use Your Framework's Routing As-Is

<Note>
  SSGOI is perfectly compatible with existing routing systems. No need to change your router!
</Note>

You can add animations while using your framework's routing as-is. Compatible with all routing approaches including Next.js `Link`, SvelteKit's `goto`, Vue Router, and more.
