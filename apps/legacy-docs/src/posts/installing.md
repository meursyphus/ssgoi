# Installing SSGOI: Your First Step Towards Magical Transitions 🧙‍♂️

Ready to add some sparkle to your Svelte app? Let's get SSGOI installed and ready to cast its transition spells!

## The Installation Incantation 🪄

Open your terminal, navigate to your project directory, and chant this magical npm command:

```bash
npm install ssgoi
```

Alternatively, if you're using Yarn, wave your wand and say:

```bash
yarn add ssgoi
```

Voila! SSGOI is now a part of your project's magical arsenal.

## Post-Installation Setup 📜

After installation, you'll need to set up SSGOI in your project. Here's a quick preview of what's coming up:

1. Create a transition configuration file
2. Set up SSGOI in your main layout file
3. Use the `PageTransition` component in your pages

We'll dive deeper into these steps in the next section, but here's a sneak peek of what your main layout file might look like:

```svelte
<script>
  import { onNavigate } from '$app/navigation';
  import { Ssgoi } from 'ssgoi';
  import config from './your-transition-config';
</script>

<Ssgoi {onNavigate} {config}>
  <slot />
</Ssgoi>
```
